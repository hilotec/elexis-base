h2. Preface

Elexis is originally a physician's practice management and electronic medical record (EMR) software. It is build on the Eclipse RCP(Rich Client Platform) and therefore extensible in many ways. The kernel is relatively small and contains some simple CRM(Customer Relationship Management) elements. Specific behaviour and capabilities are  introduced with plug-ins.

Elexis is distributed under the Eclipse Public License and thus can freely be extended or modifed. This article will help you in creating plugins for Elexis.

h2. Getting started

h3. Prerequisites

We assume that you have good knowledge of the Java programming language and at least a basic knowledge of the Eclipse environment. Beside this you'll need:
* Linux, Microsoft(tm) Windows(tm) 2000(tm) or newer,  Apple(tm) MacOS-X 10.4 or newer 
* Java jdk 1,5 or higher
* Eclipse 3.5 sdk for your os (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a>)
* A subversion client plugin for Eclipse (e.g. sublipse; Follow the instructions <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA">here</a>)

h3. Checkout the sources

After installing the subclipse plugin, open the "SVN Repository exploring" perspective in Eclipse and create a new repository location with the URL https://elexis.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/elexis/trunk.

*Do not* check out the trunk as a whole. Instead select individual projects to check out. For a minimal working elexis instance, you'll need at least the following projects:

* elexis
* elexis-utilities
* elexis-importer
* database adapter(s), one ore more of 
** mysql-adapter 
** h2-adapter
** postgresql-adapter

h3. Create a run configuration

In Eclipse, chose Run-Run configurations. Right click on "Eclipse Application" and select "New". Enter an appropriate name for the project. You should see something like here:

!runconfig1.png!

In "Program to Run" select "Run a Product" and find *ch.elexis.ElexisProduct* in the Combobox.

Then, go to the tab "Arguments":

!runconfig2.png!

If you do not change anything, elexis will run in the default locale of your operating system. If you want to try a different locale and language, you can add an -nl parameter in the upper box "Program arguments". The lower box "VM arguments" can be left empty for the beginning.

Proceed to the tab "Plug-Ins"

!runconfig3.png!

* change the "Launch with" Combobox to "plugins selected below only".
* Click "Deselect all"
* Select the Plugins you want to include (at least those above)
* Click "add required plugins"
* Click "validate plugins" and solve missing requirements, if any

Then you should be able to start elexis with "Run".

h2. Creating a plugin

Elexis plugins are basically eclipse 3.5 plugins and therefore OSGi-Bundles. You'll find a lot of literature on these topics on the web, Recommended reading includes Ed Burnette's "Rich client tutorial":http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-RCP-1/tutorial1.html, and Dave Springgay's "Eclipse Views tutorial":http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html along with other articles found on the eclipse website. There are also some books on programming OSGi Bundles and Eclipse plugins. You should have a basic knowledge on programming eclipse before proceeding.

Elexis is originally a physician's practice management and electronic medical record (EMR) software. It is build on the Eclipse RCP(Rich Client Platform) and therefore extensible in many ways. The kernel is relatively small and contains some simple CRM(Customer Relationship Management) elements. Specific behaviour and capabilities are  introduced with plug-ins.

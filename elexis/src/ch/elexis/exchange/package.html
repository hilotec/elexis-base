		<h1>eXChange</h1>
		<p>This package handles the exchange of data between different instances of elexis or
		other electronic medical record (EMR) systems.</p>
		<p>Unlike the earlier defined import-interface, we here handle not only import of a specific
		type of input, but rather a more global view on the collection of data stored in a EMR-System as a
		whole.</p>
		<p>For this purpose we define an XML-Schema (eXChange.xsd) which will, in cooperation with the informatics
			group of SGAM (Schweizerische Gesellschaft f√ºr Allgemeinmedizin), contain the minimal set of data required to
			exchange EMR contents between different EMR installations.
		</p>
		<h2>Informal description of the SgamXChange Schema</h2>
		<p>First we have to decide, what are the topmost entities we deal with. Is the Patient our central element or is it his/her
			 medical record? Or maybe his/her address? Or do we handle rather "Documents", that can, in turn, relate to patients?</p>
			<p>For this document, we use the following rules:</p>
			<p>The work in a medical practice is essentially about: interaction with persons or institutions. We have a different 
			"deep" knowledge about different enitities. For some, we have a whole medical record, others are only known by name
			or address. However, they all are "Contacts".</p>
		<p>And thus, the topmost entity in the SgamXChange Schema is the "contact". contacts may only be defined at the top level
			of the file, but they can be referenced from deeper levels (see contactref)</p>
